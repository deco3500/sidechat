# What is the problem with social media and the news?
People all over the world are on social media and they love sharing their opinions! Political discussions are especially huge online but many people don't search out for different opinions. 
					People end up sharing the same stuff to the same people over and over again, perpetuating the lie that their opinion is the only one based in fact!

# How will sidechat change this?
Sidechat aims to end this "echo chamber" by allowing users to point out bias in news as part of a dynamic online social and mobile environment. Sidechat has jettisoned the traditional upvote/downvote system in favour of a political left/right rating system. If a news article posted to sidechat has been found to be biased in a particular direction, it will be given a rating to reflect this. Users can see if the articles they would most likely read are mostly skewed in one direction or if they are consuming a healthy balance of news. Users can also comment on sidechat's news articles and these comments are voted as either left or right by other users.
