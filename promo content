outline problem
With the widespread adoption of social media in the last decade, people have increasingly gone online to share their opinions and discover others. This is especially prevalent in the realm of political discussion. The topic of politics is infamous for creating divisive arguments that cause rifts amongst family and friends. Therefore, people often avoid raising politics around people who may not share their ideological viewpoint with the goal of maintaining peace and a stable relationship. Furthermore, it is common for people to retreat into safe ideological spaces, full of similarly minded people who share their political persuasion. We call these spaces "echo-chambers". 
Research has found that these echo-chambers are self-perpetuating. Users submit content to a group of like-minded people who confirm the article's truthfulness and share it to other like-minded people. Becoming known as a haven for people of a certain political perspective, the group attracts more and more like-minded members, continuously perpetuating the cycle.
