# sidechat

## Introduction

Social media has been a great platform for users to share common interests, perspectives and narratives. An issue that has emerged, however, is the creation of 'echo-chambers'. Empirical research has previously found that on social media, users have a tendency to promote narratives that fall in line with their own opinions, leading to the formation of polarised groups. Within these groups confirmation bias facilitate further spread of content. Thus, like-minded individuals can gather in homogenous online environments and lose consideration for other viewpoints (Quattrociocchi, Scala & Sunstein, 2016).

Within these communities, users achieve recognition from their peers by being awarded tallied points such as 'Likes' or 'Upvotes'. Usually, comments that do not reflect the popular opinion of the environment are neglected or downvoted, which effectively silences balanced discussion. Side Chat aims to provide a solution to this issue, by creating an environment where all voices can be heard.  
Take part in open, balanced dialogue.

## Concept

If a social media user has come across a biased political thread (e.g. on Facebook or Reddit), they can set up a side.chat thread for more open discussion. Rather than Upvotes and Downvotes, each comment in the thread can be voted as Left-leaning, Right-leaning or Balanced by other users. Each side.chat thread has an overall 'score' to indicate how biased the discussion is. The more balanced and active the thread is, the higher the thread will apear on the main page of side.chat (similar to reddit's front page). This feature encourages multiple viewpoints to be expressed, as biased discussions drop down the page and become less visible. Users can sign up with Facebook but due to the political nature of discussions have the option to remain anonymous.

The target audience for side.chat will be people, primarily young, who want a more balanced world view. Rather than deciding what their opinion is and boxing themselves in with like-minded people, side.chat's audience will want to speak with everyone, so as to gain a perspective before making political decisions.

## Decision Making and Progression

Decisions will be made by group consensus, all team members will agree before proceeding.

## Conflict Resolution

Any concerns will be raised with the person concerned, letting them know what the issue is and some clear steps they can take to resolve the issue. If a person is unreachable for an unreasonable amount of time, Andrew Dekker and the tutors will be informed.

## Communications

Meetings will take place on Fridays from 10am-12pm during the workshop session. Outside of these hours, Slack and Facebook Messenger will be the primary means of communication. Files will be stored on Github and a shared folder on Google Drive.
